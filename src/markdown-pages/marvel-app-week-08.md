description: A Marvel App with API using global state. It consumes the Marvel API for Characters, Comics and Stories. I decided to use Context API to manage the state of the application because it is a good practice to use it and Redux is more complex and heavy for this app.
stack: HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, React, Hooks, TypeScript, ContextAPI
